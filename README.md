### Oscar's Adventure!

This is a project I made in the summer of 2021 as the culmination of what I have learned in python  
so far. I have never taken a programming class of any sort before this summer, but I wanted to use  
python as a stepping stone to other languages. I also got to experiment with GIMP for making things  
like the sprite, the platforms, etc., which I also found to be valuable experience if I ever want to try and  
make another game. Python has been super fun and easy to learn, and I think what I have learned  
about the fundamentals of programming through this language will be valuable as I continue on. 


Oscar's Adventure is a tile-based 2d platformer made using pygame, which follows a poorly-drawn cat  
named Oscar jumping over spikes, using moving platforms, and avoiding feral rats in order to get home.  
Some levels are actually quite difficult, but are definitely possible to beat, so give it your  
best shot!  

Side note: There are quite a few sound/image files so make sure they are all downloaded if you intend  
to play the game!

### Credits

For this project, I referenced a fantastic tutorial series by Coding with Russ (I will leave a link to his  
channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPrRY0S-VzekrJK7I7F4-Mg)) throughout my time making this game. 

For the sound effects, I got most of them off of [Freesound](https://freesound.org/). This includes things like the meows, the  
clicks, and the victory sound.

I will also leave a link to the background music I used [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddrs6FXIJ-g&list=PLwJjxqYuirCLkq42mGw4XKGQlpZSfxsYd&index=20&ab_channel=FreeMusic).
